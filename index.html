I like to keep things like this simple, my name is Joe I'm from the south side of Chicago, I lived in two state my whole entire life AZ and IL. I'm an avid baseball and football watches, probably because I've played both sports really was only good at baseball because I started playing at the age of five.  If anyone who is reading this wants to ever skydive please let me know I'm down just let me know.
